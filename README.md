# unsocial

Every time I post something on the web, I'm stuck in the social confirmation dillema. I know it's not good for me to count the claps and retweets of my posts. But my flesh is week... y'a know?

This Browser Extension removes those 'social' features for some of the pages I use - because I want to create content, without bothering about how much likes and shares it gets.

## Supported Pages

Currently, there is only one supported page.
**I'm thinking about adding more!** If you'd like to get a page added, comment on the medium article above or - even better - fork this repo and send me a pull request with your site added.


### **medium.com**
- filter out all notifications except for comments (because I want to answer those)
- remove the clap counters on my own articles so I don't know how many people clapped for me
- hides all links to stats
- hides all my personal stats from my profile page
